# Finance Wise (A Personal Finance Tracker)

The Finance Wise is a web application designed to help users manage their personal finances effectively. It provides users with the ability to record and track their income, expenses, and transactions, offering a comprehensive overview of their financial situation.

 Upon logging in, users are presented with a dashboard that provides an overview of their financial status. The dashboard displays key metrics such as account balances, spendings, and credits. Users can add and categorize transactions, including debits, credits, transfers, and other financial activities. Each transaction captures details like the date, amount, category, and description. The application offers a system to categorize transactions into predefined categories (e.g., Food, Bill Payments and Others).
